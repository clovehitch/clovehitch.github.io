    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    <h4>What is the Portland Area Climbers Coalition?</h4>
    <p>
      We are a member based non-profit consisting of local climbers with the
      goal of land-stewardship and maintaining access to local crags. Aspects of
      PACC include; Organizing trail work, re-bolting, building belay platforms,
      creating and maintaining contacts with land owners, working with national
      level conservation groups, and helping map more long term projects for the
      Portland area.
    </p>

    <h4>Why is PACC needed?</h4>
    <p>
      Within 2 hours of Portland there are over 25 crags containing anywhere
      from over 100 routes to a handful. There are several different government
      agencies who own the land and sometimes these are layered over each other.
      A few crags or the trails needed to get to them are on private land.
      Numerous dedicated individuals over the years have worked tirelessly to
      develop and maintain these crags. Over the years though these people have
      moved away, focused their energy into other projects, or have passed away.
      As this happens contacts with land owners fade, crags go into disrepair,
      and unsafe climbing conditions grow. PACC’s goal is to develop a long-term
      organization that can maintain over the years and funnel resources to
      better the climbing community.</p>

    <h4>Does PACC have anything to do with adding new bolts, adding new routes, or retro-bolting?</h4>
    <p>
      We hope to help fund and facilitate the replacement of degraded bolts and
      anchors. Using our own funds or working with a grant via the ASCA we will
      be helping replace bolts that are in a bad or questionable condition. The
      scope of PACC and bolts end with that.</p>

    <h4>Where does the money from membership dues go?</h4>
    <p>
      All funds go directly into resources needed for projects such as trail
      maintenance supplies, belay platforms, bolts, and anchors. A small
      percentage goes into admin cost such as web hosting and insurance. All
      board members donate their time and receive no compensation. A financial
      breakdown will be posted at the end of the year.</p>

    <h4>How can I help PACC?</h4>
    <p>
      The easiest way is to become a member. Your membership dues will be making
      a direct impact at the local crags. Throughout the year we will be hosting
      events that will need volunteers. Notifications of these will be sent out
      ahead of time so you can get involved.</p>
